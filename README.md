# ITK-SNAP Distributed Segmentation Service (DSS) Middleware Layer

This is the source code of the middleware layer for the IBM ITK-SNAP distributed segmentation service (DSS) adapted from the open source [ITK-SNAP DSS project](https://github.com/pyushkevich/alfabis_server). 


[ITK-SNAP](itksnap.org) is an interactive tool for segmentation of volumetric medical imaging datasets, like CT and MRI. 
DSS is a web-based application that allows data-scientists to make their advanced image processing algorithms available as services to ITK-SNAP users.
