This Distributed Segmenation Services (DSS) for ITK-SNAP is an adaptation of the DSS developed by Paul Yushkevich and colleagues at the Penn Image Computing and Science Laboratory ([PICSL](picsl.upenn.edu)).

It has been adapted and redesigned to run efficiently on Open Shift platform and to perform inference of IBM segmentation services on Power nodes (AC922 servers).
